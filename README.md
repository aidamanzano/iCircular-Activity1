# Linear Regression Exercise

We will be building a simple linear regression model from EU's eurostat database. We will use the dataset of: private investment and gross added value related to circular economy sectors.
You can find the source here: https://doi.org/10.2908/CEI_CIE012

Our aim is to predict Gross Added Value related to circular economy sectors in EU countries, based on their investments. From the source:

The indicator includes “Gross investment in tangible goods” and “Value added at factor costs” in the following three sectors: the recycling sector, repair and reuse sector and rental and leasing sector.

-Gross investment in tangible goods is defined as investment during the reference year in all tangible goods. Included are new and existing tangible capital goods, whether bought from third parties or produced for own use (i.e. capitalised production of tangible capital goods), having a useful life of more than one year including non-produced tangible goods such as land. Investments in intangible and financial assets are excluded.

-Value added at factor costs is the gross income from operating activities after adjusting for operating subsidies and indirect taxes. It can be calculated as the sum of turnover, capitalized production, other operating income, increases minus decreases of stocks, and deducting the following items: purchases of goods and services, other taxes on products which are linked to turnover but not deductible, duties and taxes linked to production. Value adjustments (such as depreciation) are not subtracted.

Please clone the GitHub repo, download the cleaned dataset and let's play with the code and learn.
